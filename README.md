After collecting quotes from various sources over the last two years, I created a personal database to store, manage, and access them easily. This project allows me to browse, add, and delete quotes in an organized way.

I have also added various features, such as:

1. Random Quote Generator – Displays a random quote from the database.
2. View All Quotes – Allows browsing all stored quotes at once.
3. Scrolling Quote Animation – Shows dynamic scrolling text.

A private admin Dashboard that enables me to manage adding or removing quotes.
